# London Bike Sharing Data Analysis

Welcome to our London Bike Sharing Data Analysis project. Our work focuses on the exploration and processing of an extensive dataset, originally sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hmavrodiev/london-bike-sharing-dataset). The dataset, named `london_merged.csv`, provides a comprehensive look at London's bike-sharing usage patterns.

## Project Overview

The aim of this project is to delve into the dataset using Python, primarily within a Jupyter Notebook environment, to conduct an in-depth analysis and data processing. The steps we've taken range from cleaning to transforming the data.

## Data Processing

After rigorous exploration and cleaning processes, we've transformed the data into a more refined version, aptly named `london_bikes_final.csv`. This final dataset is streamlined for further analysis or modeling work.

## Visualization

To complement our analysis, we've created a dynamic [Tableau Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/hoang.do6086/viz/LondonBikeRides_17091021284940/Dashboard1?publish=yes). This dashboard serves as a visual representation of the insights gleaned from the London bike sharing data, showcasing key trends and usage patterns.
